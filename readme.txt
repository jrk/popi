Software for arbitrary manipulation of digitized images.
The software is part of the book (Chapters 5 and 6)
``Beyond Photography - The Digital Darkroom,'' by Gerard J. Holzmann
Prentice Hall, 1988, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632, ISBN 0-13-074410-7.

This version matches the original source from the the book.
All software is written in C and should run on any system
with a standard C compiler.
The images should be decoded with the Unix command `uudecode.'
There is also a sample GWBASIC routine to display images (the
image manipulation editor itself is kept framebuffer independent).
Various extension of this source have been posted by others over
the years on the uunet newsgroup comp.sources.misc (e.g., Vol. 9, Issues 47-55).
A recent extended version is also available from an archive server in
Australia.  This 9-part (huge) set of sources can be obtained by sending
nine messages to rb-archive-server@Aus.Sun.COM, each containing the line:
send popi partn
with n = 1-9.  This version supports X11, Sunview and XView terminals,
includes support for 24 bit color images.  Bug reports on that extension
should be directed to Rich Burridge at Sun Microsystems in Australia:
richb@Aus.Sun.COM

The purpose of the original little, portable 500 line picture editor popi,
is to inspire experimentation with picture processing, and to give you
a headstart in building your own digital darkroom tools.
